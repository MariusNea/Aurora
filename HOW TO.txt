AURORA - Accessible User-friendly Resources for Optimized Research Analytics - aims to be the most comprehensive collection of Statistics and Machine Learning tools, applicable to various domains such as engineering, manufacturing, retail, and others, for addressing specific problems effectively.

The process commences with a .csv file containing the requisite information, which is initially imported as a dataframe into AURORA. Subsequently, all models are applied based on this dataframe.

Structuring the Dataframe

Regression Algorithms

Within the dataframe, all columns except the last one function as features, while the final column represents the predicted variable. The Linear Regression algorithm can accommodate any type of numerical data in the predicted column, whereas Logistic Regression and Decision Trees are suitable for categorical data.

Mann-Whitney U Test

This test is conducted between two consecutive columns in the dataframe. For instance, if there are four columns named data_1, data_2, data_3, and data_4, the Mann-Whitney U Test is performed between data_1 and data_2, and then between data_3 and data_4, respectively. Consequently, the dataframe must have an even number of columns.

Plot & Brush

By selecting a single pair of columns from the dataframe, the system plots one against the other. Selecting two pairs of columns plots both, with the option to visually analyze corresponding data on both graphs using the Brush function. After analysis, the selection can be cleared to continue with other data.

Plugin Development

AURORA supports expanding its functionality through plugins. Users can develop their plugins, add them to the /plugins folder, and AURORA will recognize them. In the current version, AURORA supports two locations on the GUI for placing buttons: one in the Statistics menu item and another in the Machine Learning menu item.

The plugins folder contains two working plugins, Mann-Whitney U Test and PCA, along with one example plugin for further development.
Please check example_plugin_a.py for instructions regarding plugin development.

Everyone is encouraged to contribute with plugins as this will help AURORA to reach its mission, to become the most comprehensive collection of Statistics and Machine Learning tools available for everyone, for free.
